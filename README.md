# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I have created a simple command line Rock-Paper-Scissor game without using any external game libraries like PyGame.
In this game, user gets the first chance to pick the option among Rock, paper and scissor. After that computer select from remaining two choices(randomly), then winner is decided as per the rules.
The rules are as follows:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
